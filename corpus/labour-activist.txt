Labour has expelled an activist for bringing the party into disrepute after he criticised a Jewish MP at the launch of an anti-Semitism report.

Marc Wadsworth accused Ruth Smeeth of working "hand in hand" with the media to undermine Labour.

Labour's National Constitutional Committee found he breached the party's rules and should be thrown out.
