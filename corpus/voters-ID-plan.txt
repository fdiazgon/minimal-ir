Government plans to make people prove their identity before voting are "deeply flawed", the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) has warned.

The scheme, which is being piloted in Bromley, Gosport, Swindon, Watford and Woking for the local elections on 3 May, is designed to combat voter fraud.

But the ERS says the new system could be a "calculated effort" to make voting harder for some citizens.
