Cesc Fabregas' 50th Premier League goal boosted Chelsea's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League as his early winner increased relegation concern for Swansea City.

Fabregas' fourth-minute curler - his first goal in the league since August - was enough to see off Swansea, who remained competitive but without a cutting edge.

The result puts Chelsea two points behind fourth-placed Tottenham, who play their game in hand against Watford on Monday.
